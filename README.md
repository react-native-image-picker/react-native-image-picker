## Installation

```bash
yarn add react-native-image-picker
```

### New Architecture

To take advantage of the new architecture run-

#### iOS

```bash
RCT_NEW_ARCH_ENABLED=1 npx pod-install ios
```

#### Android

Set `newArchEnabled` to `true` inside `android/gradle.properties`

### Pre-Fabric (AKA not using the new architecture)

```bash
npx pod-install ios
```

## Post-install Steps

### iOS

Add the appropriate keys to your `Info.plist` depending on your requirement:

### Android

No permissions required (`saveToPhotos` requires permission [check](#note-on-file-storage)).

Note: This library does not require `Manifest.permission.CAMERA`, if your app declares as using this permission in manifest then you have to obtain the permission before using `launchCamera`.

## API Reference

## Methods

```js
import {launchCamera, launchImageLibrary} from 'react-native-image-picker';
```

### `launchCamera()`

Launch camera to take photo or video.

```js
launchCamera(options?, callback);

// You can also use as a promise without 'callback':
const result = await launchCamera(options?);
```

See [Options](#options) for further information on `options`.

The `callback` will be called with a response object, refer to [The Response Object](#the-response-object).

### `launchImageLibrary`

Launch gallery to pick image or video.

```js
launchImageLibrary(options?, callback)

// You can also use as a promise without 'callback':
const result = await launchImageLibrary(options?);
```

See [Options](#options) for further information on `options`.

The `callback` will be called with a response object, refer to [The Response Object](#the-response-object).

## Note on file storage

Image/video captured via camera will be stored in temporary folder allowing it to be deleted any time, so don't expect it to persist. Use `saveToPhotos: true` (default is `false`) to save the file in the public photos. `saveToPhotos` requires `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission on Android 28 and below (The permission has to obtained by the App manually as the library does not handle that).

For web, this doesn't work.
