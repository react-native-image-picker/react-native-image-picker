### Make sure you're reading the doc applicable to your version, for example if your using version 3.8.0 go to tag 3.8.0 and read those docs. This doc is always that of main branch.

### Also read version release notes for any breaking changes especially if you're updating the major version.

# Install

```
yarn add react-native-image-picker

# RN >= 0.60
cd ios && pod install

# RN < 0.60
react-native link react-native-image-picker
```

## Post-install Steps

### iOS

Add the appropriate keys to your Info.plist,

If you are allowing user to select image/video from photos, add `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription`.

If you are allowing user to capture image add `NSCameraUsageDescription` key also.

If you are allowing user to capture video add `NSCameraUsageDescription` add `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` key also.

### Android

No permissions required (`saveToPhotos` requires permission [check](#note-on-file-storage)).

Note: This library does not require Manifest.permission.CAMERA, if your app declares as using this permission in manifest then you have to obtain the permission before using `launchCamera`.

# API Reference

## Methods

```js
import {launchCamera, launchImageLibrary} from 'react-native-image-picker';
```

### `launchCamera()`

Launch camera to take photo or video.

```js
launchCamera(options?, callback);

// You can also use as a promise without 'callback':
const result = await launchCamera(options?);
```

See [Options](#options) for further information on `options`.

The `callback` will be called with a response object, refer to [The Response Object](#the-response-object).

### `launchImageLibrary`

Launch gallery to pick image or video.

```js
launchImageLibrary(options?, callback)

// You can also use as a promise without 'callback':
const result = await launchImageLibrary(options?);
```

See [Options](#options) for further information on `options`.

The `callback` will be called with a response object, refer to [The Response Object](#the-response-object).

## Note on file storage

Image/video captured via camera will be stored in temporary folder so will be deleted any time, so don't expect it to persist. Use `saveToPhotos: true` (default is false) to save the file in the public photos. `saveToPhotos` requires WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission on Android 28 and below (You have to obtain the permission, the library does not).

For web this doesn't work.
